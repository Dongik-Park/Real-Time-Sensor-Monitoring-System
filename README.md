# Real-Time-Sensor-Monitoring-System

### This project is based on C#, Winforms, MS-SQL.

**It has three basic functions.**
> 1. Real-time PC(Core Temperatrue, CPU occupied, Memory Usage), Modbus, Vibration sensor monitoring. 
> 2. Sensor data save & search
> 3. Sensor configs manage

**Check these three points when you using this project.**
> 1. If you want to add new configs of sensor, your SensorReader should be inherited BaseSensorReader. 
> 2. i utilized linq-to-sql ORM to save sensor data on MS-SQL. So, you should check SensorData.dbml.
> 3. Actived sensors read, upload UI chart and DB - transaction occurs every 2 seconds.
